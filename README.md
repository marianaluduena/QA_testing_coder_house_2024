# QA_testing_coder_house_2024

This is my first QA Manual testing project.
Please not that this project is in spanish.

I've wrote the test cases (both positives as negatives), then I've tested each of them and added the evidence (failed or not). By doing so I've used the tool Screen to Gif, because I consider a GIF is way more graphic and easy to undestand than just a mere image, and easy to reproduce a bug if there's any.
This project includes an API testing with the Pok√©API instead of the official APIs of the web site I'm working with, because it is just a project for a course. To do so I'm using Postman. The task is to learn how to test APIs and how to read all the informantion it brings in each request.
